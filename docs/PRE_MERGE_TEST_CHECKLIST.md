# Pre-Merge Test Checklist — feat/multi-runtime

**Branch:** feat/multi-runtime
**Date:** 2025-07-XX (fill before testing)
**Tester:** ___________

> Quick sanity before merging into main. Each section takes ~2 minutes.
> Expected results are concrete — if you see something different, **stop and report**.

## 0. Quick Smoke (1 min)

```bash
node scripts/smoke.mjs
```

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Backend starts | `✅ Backend startup` |  |
| Board creation | `✅ POST /boards` |  |
| Graph load | `✅ PUT /graph` |  |
| Graph round-trip | `✅ GET /graph` |  |
| Status (idle) | `✅ GET /status` |  |
| Node CRUD | `✅ POST /nodes` + `POST /edges` |  |
| Cleanup | `✅ DELETE /boards` |  |

If `pi` is on PATH, also:
| Node run | `✅ POST /run` + status = running |  |

---

## 1. Regression: Pi Runtime (default) — 3 min

1. Open the UI (`http://localhost:3847`).
2. Create a board with cwd = a real project directory.
3. Add two nodes (Architect → Developer), wire an edge.
4. Click **Run** on the Architect node.

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Pi spawns | Terminal shows pi's prompt |  |
| Agent responds | Architect executes the task |  |
| Handoff | Architect hands off to Developer automatically |  |
| Developer runs | Developer terminal activates |  |
| Terminal output | Scrollback visible, no garbled characters |  |

---

## 2. Ring-Buffer Scrollback — 3 min

This tests that the ring buffer (256 KB cap) works correctly under heavy output.

1. In the running node's terminal, run a verbose command:
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 100000); do echo "line $i"; done
   ```
2. While it's still running, **detach** (navigate away from the board).
3. Wait for the command to finish.
4. **Re-attach** by clicking the node card again.

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Output streams live | Lines appear in real-time |  |
| Detach + re-attach | Scrollback is replayed (last ~256 KB) |  |
| No crash | UI stays responsive during heavy output |  |
| No OOM | Memory doesn't balloon (ring buffer caps at 256 KB) |  |
| Buffer trimming | Oldest output is trimmed; latest is preserved |  |

**Bonus:** run `yes | head -n 500000` — the terminal should stay smooth.

---

## 3. Runtime Selector in UI — 2 min

1. Open the board editor.
2. Click on a node card → edit settings.
3. Look for the **Runtime** dropdown (should show "pi" and "hermes").

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Dropdown visible | Shows "pi" (default) and "hermes" |  |
| Select hermes | Node saves with `runtime: "hermes"` |  |
| Select pi | Node saves with `runtime: "pi"` |  |
| Graph persistence | After reload, runtime choice is preserved |  |

> Note: the hermes runtime won't actually spawn unless step 4 is configured.

---

## 4. Hermes Runtime Path — 3 min

### 4a. Plugin Setup

```bash
bash scripts/setup-hermes-plugin.sh
export PINODES_ORCHESTRA_HERMES=true
```

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Symlink created | `~/.hermes/plugins/orchestra → backend/hermes-plugins/orchestra/` |  |
| Idempotent | Running again says "already correct" |  |
| Flag printed | Script prints `PINODES_ORCHESTRA_HERMES=true` |  |

### 4b. Runtime Test

1. Restart the backend with `PINODES_ORCHESTRA_HERMES=true`.
2. Create a board, add a node with **runtime: hermes**.
3. Run it.

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Hermes spawns | Terminal shows hermes TUI (`hermes --tui`) |  |
| Plugin loads | No "plugin not found" errors in hermes output |  |
| Tool available | Agent has `orchestra_handoff` tool |  |
| Handoff works | Can hand off to a connected pi node |  |

> If `hermes` is not installed, the node should exit gracefully (not crash the backend).

---

## 5. Edge Cases (optional, 2 min)

| Check | Expected | ✅/❌ |
|-------|----------|------|
| Self-loop rejected | UI/API returns error for a → a edge |  |
| Non-final node with no edges | Cannot save graph (validation error) |  |
| Delete running board | Board + terminals cleaned up |  |
| Auth token | Setting `PINODES_ORCHESTRA_TOKEN` blocks unauthenticated requests |  |
