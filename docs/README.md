## Document lifecycle

| Folder | When to add here |
|--------|------------------|
| `guides/` | Describes **current** behavior users/operators rely on |
| `roadmaps/` | Multi-phase vision; update status columns as phases ship |
| `plans/` | Step-by-step implementation spec for a feature branch |
| `checklists/` | Repeatable QA / release gates |
| `archive/` | Spikes and pre-build analysis — **read-only** after feature ships |
| `reviews/` | Point-in-time audit/review; do not edit unless re-auditing |

When a plan is fully implemented, move it (and its supporting spikes) to `archive/` and mark it ✅ in this index.
