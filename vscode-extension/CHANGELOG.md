# Changelog

All notable changes to the **PiNodes Orchestra** extension are documented here.

## 0.2.9

### Fixed

- **Windows/macOS: agent nodes stuck on "starting pi"** because the packaged
  backend shipped without `node-pty`'s native binaries. Recent `node-pty` keeps
  them under `prebuilds/<platform>/` (prebuildify layout), but the bundler only
  copied `build/Release` plus a hardcoded `linux-x64` prebuild — so `pty.node`/
  `conpty.node` were missing everywhere except Linux and spawning `pi` failed
  silently. The bundler now ships the prebuild for the target platform.
- **"starting pi…" overlay now behaves consistently across platforms.** It clears
  when pi has actually booted (its extension reports `session_start`) instead of
  on the first raw PTY byte — which on Windows is a ConPTY init escape emitted
  before pi is up, hiding the overlay too early. A fallback timer still reveals
  the terminal if a node never reports ready.

### Changed

- Graph validation now rejects self-loop edges and edges referencing unknown
  nodes on **every** graph-edit path (`PUT …/graph` and `/flows`, not just the
  granular edge endpoint), matching the documented programmatic-API behavior.

## 0.2.8

### Fixed

- **Windows: agent nodes failed to start** because the backend spawned the bare
  `pi` binary, which does not exist on Windows (the npm launcher is `pi.cmd`).
  PATH resolution now tries `pi.cmd`, `pi.exe`, `pi.bat`, then `pi` on Windows,
  so the `pi` CLI is found and spawned correctly. Other platforms are unchanged.

## 0.2.7

- Deterministic handoff via per-turn system prompt + intent watchdog.

## 0.2.6

- Granular node/edge CRUD, CLI wrapper, flow auto-cleanup.

## 0.2.5

- Auto-start node pi on load; mirror-terminal width fixes; self-contained
  per-platform bundle; pi prerequisite check; Open VSX publishing.
